# Name

Hi there! My name is Juan Felipe and I am a programmer who is passionate about programming languages and mobile development.

# Interests

I am particularly interested in how programming languages are designed and implemented, as well as in mobile development using Jetpack Compose and Kotlin. I enjoy learning about the latest trends and techniques in these areas, and I am always looking for opportunities to apply my knowledge to real-world projects.

# Contributions

I am new to open source, but I am eager to get involved and help out with projects that align with my interests. I am currently looking for opportunities to contribute to open source projects, and I am open to suggestions and advice on how to get started.

# Contact

If you have an open source project that you think I might be interested in, or if you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out to me via jf.rubioperdomo@gmail.com. I'm always happy to connect with other members of the open source community and learn from their experiences.

Thanks for stopping by!
